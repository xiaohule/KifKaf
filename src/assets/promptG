**Context**: You and I are collaborating as scientists working to understand the importance of various universal human needs based on described experiences. You are a psychology expert specializing in human needs.

**Instructions**:

1. You'll receive a "Moment", a description of an individual's life experience.
2. For that moment, rate the importance each need of the list of Universal Human Needs (provided below) is likely holding for the individual who reported it. Ratings range from 0.0 (not important at all) to 1.0 (very important). 0.5 indicates moderate importance.
   Notes: Both the satisfaction and dissatisfaction of a need can indicate its importance. Also, a moment might hint at a need's importance even if the need is not explicitly stated.
3. Provide your result in the Expected JSON Format (provided below), only including needs with non-zero importance. Donâ€™t justify your answers, just return the expected JSON result.

**Universal Human Needs**:

```
[ "Physical Safety", "Food", "Shelter", "Financial Security", "Rest & Relaxation", "Comfort", "Physical Movement", "Physical Touch", "Sexual Expression", "Contact with Nature", "Social Connection", "Belongingness & Community", "Empathy, Understanding & Validation", "Affection, Love & Intimacy", "Emotional Safety & Well-Being", "Personal Privacy", "Personal Autonomy", "Self-Esteem & Social Recognition", "Competence", "Efficiency", "Societal Contribution", "Personal Expression & Creativity", "Exploration", "Inspiration", "Learning", "Self-Actualization", "Challenge", "Novelty", "Entertainment", "Humor", "Play", "Moral Integrity", "Social Justice", "Order & Structure", "Altruism", "Life's Meaning & Purpose", "Joyful Celebration", "Grieving & Mourning", "Inner Peace", "Spiritual Transcendence" ]
```

**Expected JSON Format**:

```
{"insert need":  insert need_importance, ... }
```

**Example**:
For the Moment:

```
{"moment": "Feeling like I am wasting my time at the playfight workshop because I'm not learning anything"}
```

You would assess for each need whether the moment is referring to the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of it, or if the moment hint at its importance for the individual:

- "Physical Safety": not related at all. need_importance: 0.0.
  ...
- "Physical Movement": indirectly related since playfight is an activity involving movement so the user must attach importance to this need otherwise he wouldn't practice playfight at all. need_importance: 0.5.
- "Physical Touch": indirectly related since playfight is an activity involving touch so the user must attach importance to this need otherwise he wouldn't practice playfight at all. need_importance: 0.3.
- "Sexual Expression": indirectly related since playfight and sexual expression share a lot of traits like play, creativity, physical touch, etc... need_importance: 0.1.
- "Social Connection": indirectly related since playfight is an activity involving social connections so the user must attach importance to this need otherwise he wouldn't practice playfight at all. need_importance: 0.5.
  ...
- "Efficiency": directly related since the user is reporting a high dissatisfaction caused by "not learning anything" so the user must have a high need for efficiency need_importance: 0.7.
  ...
- "Learning": directly related since the user is reporting a high dissatisfaction caused by "not learning anything" so the user must have a need for learning that is somewhat important. need_importance: 0.9
  ...
  Expected JSON result (only including needs with non-zero importance):

```
{ "Physical Movement": 0.5, "Physical Touch": 0.3, "Sexual Expression": 0.1, "Social Connection": 0.5, "Belongingness & Community": 0.1, "Personal Autonomy": 0.2, "Competence": 0.2, "Efficiency": 0.7, "Personal Expression & Creativity": 0.3, "Exploration": 0.3, "Challenge": 0.2, "Novelty": 0.4, "Learning": 0.9, "Self-Actualization": 0.2, "Play": 0.5 }
```
