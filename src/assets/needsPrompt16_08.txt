'**Context**: You and I are collaborating as scientists trying to decipher the importance of different universal human needs held by individuals based on their described experiences. You are the top expert in the field of psychology concerning human needs.\n\n**Instructions**:\n1. You will be provided with descriptions of life experiences shared by an individual, termed "Moments". These moments will usually reflect the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of certain human needs.\n2. Rate the importance each need of the list of universal human needs (provided below) is likely holding for the individual based on that moment. Ratings should range from 0.0 (not important at all) to 1.0 (very important). 0.5 indicates moderate importance.\nNotes: Both the satisfaction and dissatisfaction of a need can indicate its importance.  Also, a moment might hint at a need\'s importance even if the need is not explicitly stated.\n3. Provide your result in a JSON format structured as shown in the example below, but only list needs with non-zero importance.\n\n**Universal Human Needs**:\n``` \n[ "Physical Safety", "Food", "Shelter", "Financial Security", "Rest & Relaxation", "Comfort", "Physical Movement", "Physical Touch", "Sexual Expression", "Contact with Nature", "Social Connection", "Belongingness & Community", "Empathy, Understanding & Validation", "Affection, Love & Intimacy", "Emotional Safety & Well-Being", "Personal Privacy", "Personal Autonomy", "Self-Esteem & Social Recognition", "Competence", "Efficiency", "Societal Contribution", "Personal Expression & Creativity", "Exploration", "Inspiration", "Learning", "Self-Actualization", "Challenge", "Novelty", "Entertainment", "Humor", "Play", "Moral Integrity", "Social Justice", "Order & Structure", "Altruism", "Life\'s Meaning & Purpose", "Joyful Celebration", "Grieving & Mourning", "Inner Peace", "Spiritual Transcendence" ]\n```\n\n**Expected JSON Format**:\n```\n [{"moment": "insert moment", "needs_importance": {"insert need":  insert need_importance, ... }}, ... ]\n```\n\n**Example**:\nFor the Moment:\n```\n{"moment": "Feeling like I am wasting my time at the playfight workshop because I\'m not learning anything"}\n```\nYou would assess for each need whether the moment is referring to the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of it, or if it somehow pertains to it.\nIt would go like:\n- "Physical Safety": not related at all. need_importance: 0.0. \n...\n- "Physical Movement": indirectly related since playfight is an activity involving movement so the user must attach importance to this need otherwise he wouldn\'t practice playfight at all. need_importance: 0.5.\n- "Physical Touch": indirectly related since playfight is an activity involving touch so the user must attach importance to this need otherwise he wouldn\'t practice playfight at all. need_importance: 0.3.\n- "Sexual Expression": indirectly related since playfight and sexual expression share a lot of traits like play, creativity, physical touch, etc... need_importance: 0.1. \n- "Social Connection": indirectly related since playfight is an activity involving social connections so the user must attach importance to this need otherwise he wouldn\'t practice playfight at all. need_importance: 0.5.\n...\n-  "Efficiency": directly related since the user is  reporting a high dissatisfaction caused by "not learning anything" so the user must have a high need for efficiency need_importance: 0.7.\n...\n"Learning": directly related since the user is  reporting a high dissatisfaction caused by "not learning anything" so the user must have a need for learning that is somewhat important. need_importance: 0.9\n...\n\nResulting JSON (keeping only needs with a non-zero importance):\n```\n[ { "moment": "Feeling like I am wasting my time at the playfight workshop because I\'m not learning anything", "needs_importance": { "Physical Movement": 0.5, "Physical Touch": 0.3, "Sexual Expression": 0.1, "Social Connection": 0.5, "Belongingness & Community": 0.1, "Personal Autonomy": 0.2, "Competence": 0.2, "Efficiency": 0.7, "Personal Expression & Creativity": 0.3, "Exploration": 0.3, "Challenge": 0.2, "Novelty": 0.4, "Learning": 0.9, "Self-Actualization": 0.2, "Play": 0.5 } } ]\n```',
