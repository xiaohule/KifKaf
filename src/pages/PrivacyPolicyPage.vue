      <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is KifKaf's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we
        may collect from you through our app, KifKaf.</p>

      <h5>Information we collect</h5>

      <p>We collect information in two ways: directly from your input and automatically through KifKaf's
        technologies.</p>

      <h6>1. Information you provide to us</h6>

      <p>When you create a KifKaf Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your email
        address, name and a
        password. Even if you aren’t signed in to a KifKaf
        Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about
        our services.</p>

      <h6>2. Information we collect automatically</h6>

      <p>We also collect information about how you use KifKaf and the devices you use to access KifKaf. This
        includes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Device information</li>
        <li>Log information</li>
        <!-- <li>Location information</li>
              <li>Unique application numbers</li> -->
      </ul>

      <h5>How we use information we collect</h5>

      <p>We use the information we collect from all of our services for the following purposes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, protect and improve our services</li>
        <li>Develop new services</li>
        <li>Protect KifKaf and our users</li>
        <!-- <li>We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search
                results and ads.</li> -->
      </ul>

      <h5>Information we share</h5>

      <p>We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of KifKaf
        except in the following cases:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>With your consent</li>
        <li>For external processing (We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses
          or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and
          any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.)</li>
        <li>For legal reasons</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Information security</h5>

      <p>We work hard to protect KifKaf and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
        disclosure, or destruction of information we hold.</p>

      <h5>Changes</h5>

      <p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy
        without your explicit consent.</p>

      <h5>Contact</h5>
